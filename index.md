## Research Data Access & Preservation Workshop: Collaborative Curation of Open Educational Datasets

The RDAP Education & Resources committee presents the first in a series of online, interactive workshops: Collaboratively Curating Open, Educational Datasets. Participants in this event will have an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with common data curation strategies and tools by curating a publicly available dataset to improve its FAIR-ness and educational fitness-for-purpose.

## Objectives

* Develop a process for collaborative, online data curation.
* Augment the existing metadata records to support discoverability, access, and use of the data.
* Curate for long term preservation in UNM's non-public archive. This includes augmenting the data to include administrative and preservation metadata.
* Initiate development of lesson plans or lab activities that use the data to demonstrate data curation or archaeological methods or strategies.

## Activities

The following activities are suggestions for getting a start toward the objectives listed above. Actual activities may vary depending on the interests and priorities of participants.

* Develop a master data dictionary: Many of the spreadsheets have similar column headings, so we may work toward creating a “master” data table definition document (via a wiki or a README). Units of measurement are also needed. This might lend itself to or benefit from cross-referencing the data files to compare column headers. An in-depth review of column headings may also help sort out the raw data from the results/reports.
* Metadata augmentation: In addition to the finding aid at <https://rmoa.unm.edu/docviewer.php?docId=nmumss1058bc.xml#idm45473692681952>, there is a document in the digital collection which details the soil sampling process (<https://econtent.unm.edu/digital/collection/cordell/id/25/rec/125>). Using this additional info to see how we might augment the metadata for some of the CSV files may be productive. Using these documents or other info, can we associate specific data files with specific publications listed in the finding aid?
* Cross reference sample IDs: Many of the data files have a sample ID or similar column. Can we disambiguate ID usage and find a "path" through the data from raw data to results?
* A reproducibility exercise: A few of the datasets, for example <https://econtent.unm.edu/digital/collection/cordell/id/90/rec/127>, look like the results of analyses. Finding a path through the available data to reproduce some of these results would be very valuable from a curation standpoint, and may also support instruction in archaeological methods such as principle component and/or trace element analysis. Maybe we can get a start on a Jupyter or R notebook for this and/or any of the cross-referencing tasks?

## Resources

For the event, we will refer to the following references and resources:
