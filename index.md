## Research Data Access & Preservation Workshop: Collaborative Curation of Open Educational Datasets

The RDAP Education & Resources committee presents the first in a series of online, interactive workshops: Collaboratively Curating Open, Educational Datasets. Participants in this event will have an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with common data curation strategies and tools by curating a publicly available dataset to improve its FAIR-ness and educational fitness-for-purpose.

This page will be continuously updated ahead of the hackathon. 

## Objectives

* Augment the existing metadata records to support discoverability, access, and use of the data.
* Curate for long term preservation in UNM's non-public archive. This includes augmenting the data to include administrative and preservation metadata.
* Initiate development of lesson plans or lab activities that use the data to demonstrate data curation or archaeological methods or strategies.
